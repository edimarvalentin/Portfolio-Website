        <p class="lead">I’m Edimar Valentín Kery, an undergraduate student of The Computer Science and Engineering
          Department at the University of Puerto Rico,
          Mayagüez Campus. I’m a hands-on developer with experience in many areas where coding is required. I have
          worked with robotics, video-game development,
          mobile, desktop and web applications. I even tackled data science at a certain point.</p>
        <p class="lead">My career in computer science began way before I set foot on college. My introduction to code
          was merely a coincidence, no one in my family was good
          with computers and only my mother had higher level education. When I was a young teen, I just liked to play
          games on my mom’s computer. I wanted to be a commercial
          pilot at the time, so I had no curiosity of the inner workings of the computer I was using and just assumed
          the electrons inside were smart. Two games I liked to
          play eventually invited my curiosity. The games ‘Minecraft’ and ‘Roblox’ invited their players to be creative
          and make their own things and one day I caved. I
          bravely went to the documentation pages to discover that if you want to make your own custom game objects, you
          had to learn this thing called ‘Lua’.
          I started reading and within minutes I had printed my first ‘Hello, World!’ in the console.</p>
        <p class="lead">When I got into high school, I enrolled into the school’s vocational program where I took
          electronics. My teachers were ex-alumni on the university I
          am enrolled as of now and they knew a lot about computers. During my time there, I learned how simple logic
          circuits make up the modern-day computer and the things
          I learned prior to that came together to supplement what I was learning. That’s when I knew where I was headed
          and what type of work I will do. </p>
